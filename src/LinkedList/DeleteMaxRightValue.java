/**
 * Given the head node of a singly linked list, modify the list such that any node that has a node with a greater value to its right gets removed.
 * The function should return the head of the modified list.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: 5 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
 * Output: 7 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
 * Explanation: 5 and 3 are removed as they have nodes with larger values to their right.
