/**
 * Given the head of a Singly LinkedList that contains a cycle, write a function to find the starting node of the cycle.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: tail connects to node index 1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: tail connects to node index 0
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: no cycle
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
