/**
 * You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. The farm has a single row of fruit trees. You will be given two baskets,
 * and your goal is to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.
 *
 * You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. The farm has following restrictions:
 *
 * Each basket can have only one type of fruit. There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
 * You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
 * You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: fruits = [1,2,1]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can pick from all 3 trees.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2].
 * If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: fruits = [0,1,2,2]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can pick from trees [1,2,2].
 * If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [0,1].
